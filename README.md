# Mapping_the_Commodore_64_Excel

It is finally here, but not complete yet. However you will have access to the Commodore 64 memory map information and programs in this Excel spreadsheet. Currently it contains memory addresses 0-62097 (65535 total - to go)

When I have time I will try to finish it, but right now I have other projects going.

However the majority of addresses here will be beneficial.
